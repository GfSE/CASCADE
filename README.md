# CASCaDE Layered Ontology

The project is a joint initiative of GfSE e.V. and Prostep iViP e.V.. Goal is to submit a standard candidate at OMG - addressed at a Request for Proposals yet to be prepared and issued. Both organizations bring along the results of previously independent projects, namely the Specification Integration Facility (SpecIF) and the Digital Data Package (DDP).

The CASCaDE layered ontology aims at facilitating collaboration in the product lifecycle from conception to retirement. 

This is a proposal and we are happy about any critical feedback and proposal for improvement: We are looking for the most useful and versatile representation and every experience in this context is very valuable.

The status is very initial:
- The models in SysML (Cameo) are incomplete - except for FMC and VDI2206 which are already rather advanced.
- The transformation from Cameo XMI to SpecIF is rudimentary. Only diagrams, blocks in BDDs and IBDs as well as generalizations and some associations are included, at this point in time.
- The transformation from SpecIF to RDF is very incomplete, as well. The properties and datatypes are missing. Also the eligible subject and object classes for statements are ignored, so far.

Yet, if you are interested have a look and let us know.
